# OOP-Progress-Check

Goals

This assignment will demonstrate your understanding of object-oriented programming with PHP using the following OOP principles:

The basics of programming in PHP, i.e. variables, functions, loops, conditionals and arrays
Using separate, dedicated files to modularize your code
Classes and methods
Properties and visibility
__get & __set magic methods
Class inheritance
Override methods

Instructions

Note: Prior to writing your code, you will be required to plan this out using either paper/pencil, index cards or a Lucidchart. If you elect the paper and pencil method, please take pictures of each element/phase  of your process and save them to a file. You will need to turn these in with your final code files. If you choose Lucidchart, you will need to produce that at the end as well.

Create two separate files with a .php extension and name them whatever you want
Use the include function to connect your two documents
Create at least one or more classes (these can be anything you wish them to be… but stick with the fundamental principles of OOP)
Add attributes (no less than three) to your class/es
Add methods (no less than two) to your class/es
Utilize the _get & _set magic methods
Utilize the $this variable
Instantiate your object/s
Utilize the ‘new’ keyword
Set your object’s properties using the methods you created
Utilize constructor objects
Create an object using the constructor method
Restrict access to certain properties using ‘access modifiers’
Restrict access to certain methods using ‘access modifiers’
Utilize inheritance principles by extending the parent class
Utilize at least one override method for property in a child class

When you are finished, you will create your OWN repository for your code in GitHub, push your changes, and then share the link for your repository in this assignment post.
